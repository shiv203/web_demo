## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]

Whether you need to create a quick website for a friend, a flexible web service for a client or a large, enterprise application, Flask is worth checking out. Flask is an easy to configure, but full-featured microframework for creating web apps in the Python language. You can use it for everything from a static site to an interactive app or REST API. 

In this course, Derek Jensen will show you how easy it is to get up and running with Flask. You'll learn everything you need to know to create a Flask web app from scratch. You'll cover all the basics starting with scaffolding, and moving on to templates, creating and handling forms, and sessions with user login. This may sound like a lot, but follow along with this course and you'll see how easy it is to get up to speed with Flask and start using it on your next project.
